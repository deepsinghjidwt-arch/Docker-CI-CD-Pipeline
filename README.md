# Features

- 3-Tier Architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database)
-  High Availability using multiple container replicas
-  Stateless backend design
-  Persistent database using Docker volumes
-  Redis caching for performance improvement
-  NGINX load balancing & reverse proxy
-  Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
-  Production-ready & Kubernetes-ready design

---

# CI/CD Pipeline Flow (Jenkins)

1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. Jenkins pulls latest code
3. Docker images are built
4. Containers are deployed using Docker Compose
5. Application is available via NGINX

---

# Docker Compose Highlights

- Multiple services defined in a single file
- Isolated network for internal communication
- Persistent volume for database
- Easy horizontal scaling using replicas
- Centralized entry point via NGINX

---

#NGINX Responsibilities

- Acts as a **single entry point**
- Routes traffic to frontend & backend
- Load balances requests
- Improves security & performance

---

# Scalability & High Availability

- Backend & frontend containers are **stateless**
- Multiple replicas ensure fault tolerance
- Redis reduces database load

---

# Security Best Practices

- Environment variables for credentials
- Network isolation using Docker networks
- No hardcoded secrets in application code
- Reverse proxy hides internal services
